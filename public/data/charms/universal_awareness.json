Artifacts glow, hearthstones burn, and all Essence use is visible as if the user had an anima. The user may roll Sagacity to analyze spirit magics, sorcery, demesnes, Wyld, or Underworld phenomena or identify Charm use. Difficulty varies by effectThe Exalt may gaze into the world’s Essence and unravel the patterns of magic that make up Creation. The secrets of Creation’s mystical workings, spirit magics, and sorcery are unveiled. Commit 1 mote for the scene. The Exalt perceives the presence of Essence, including dematerialized spirits and borders between worlds such as the Wyld or shadowlands as gauzy distortions. Attuned artifacts appear as though lit from within, and hearthstones burn like embers. Whenever a character uses Essence to power Charms or any other effects, these are always visible to the user as though the character had an active anima. They may make Sagacity rolls to try to understand spirit magics, sorcerous workings, and other strange phenomena like those produced by demesnes, the Wyld, and the Underworld or to identify the use of a Charm. Such effects may have variable difficulty — typically 2 + the creator’s Essence or a difficulty modified by the effect’s nature and complexity.",
